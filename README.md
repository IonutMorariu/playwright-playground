# Playwright playground

This is a small playwright environment with typescript. You can clone it and play around with the tool.
In order to run it, you need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/es/download/) installed.

Once you've cloned the repo, install the deps with:

```bash
    npm install
```

There are several commands available to you:

```
    npm start: Run ts-node in watch mode
    npm run build: Build the files to the /dist folder
    npm run test: Run all test suites with jest
```

Happy coding!
